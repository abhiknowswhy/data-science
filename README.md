This repository is for documenting my learnings on some Data Science algorithms

- Classification and regression
  - Linear regression + Logistic regression
  - Naive Bayes classification
  - [Random Forest Algorithm](https://github.com/abhiknowswhy/data-science/blob/main/RandomForest.ipynb)
  - [K-means clustering](https://github.com/abhiknowswhy/data-science/blob/main/KMeansClustering.ipynb)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- Data cleaning
  - Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Dimensionality reduction using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

- Adjunct concepts
  - Distances - KL Divergence, Euclidian distance, Manhattan distance, Chebyshev, Levenshtein
  - ML Model metrics - accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, confusion matrix
